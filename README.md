# solar-tracker


Recently, we had solar panels installed in our home. But they were fixed so, i thought what if they move with the sun's rotation. I knew about the LDR sensor and its working so i thought this could be an innovation to existing technology of solar panels. So i quicly wenn ton to google so that i could see if there is any research done on this very topic and yes it is very common idea. But here i am again working and making it on tinkercad. Beacuse hardware implementation is bit costly so tikercad a free to use tool doeas a lot for me to give a nearly practical aspect of projects.





**Components Required**

1)ARDUINO UNO R3	

2)Servo Motor	Micro Servo - SG90	

3)LDR	 ( Photoresistor) Sensor	

4)Resistors	10k-ohm resistors

5)Breadboard	Mini Breadboard	

6)3D body parts	3D body parts Design	

7)Potentiometer






**Working Principle of LDR Sensor**

LDR Works as a light detector. It is also known as a photoresistor. Actually, It is a light Sensitive device. In this project, we are using 4 LDRs to detect the Sunlight. And when they send Signal to the Arduino, It will guide two Servo Motors to better place the solar panel to maximize its efficiency.

Here is the circuit. I have copied it from " The IOT Project"

Here is the tinkercad link for it. https://www.tinkercad.com/things/9sBJpAuKQjP-arduino-based-dual-axis-solar-tracker
I have used code to refer. 
Code uploaded is bit modified. Bt you can use their code for reference over mine because it also includes comment for each statement.
